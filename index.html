            const demoData = {
                beliefs: `My most central belief is that the irrational is the only true path to knowledge. I believe that the contents of the subconscious mind—dreams, desires, paranoia—contain a truth more profound than that of everyday reality. Later in life, I came to believe that the discoveries of modern physics, particularly quantum mechanics and the structure of the atom, were a new path to the mystical and the divine. For me, science and spirituality were not opposed; they were two sides of the same glorious, incomprehensible reality.`,
                rules: `My primary rule for creation was the 'paranoiac-critical method.' This was a system for actively inducing a state of paranoia to misinterpret the world, allowing me to see hidden forms and connections—like seeing elephants in the reflection of swans. This was not madness, but a controlled, systematic exploration of the irrational. Another rule was an absolute mastery of classical technique. To paint like a madman, one must first know how to paint like Raphael. This technical perfection was the necessary container for my irrational explorations.`,
                ontology: `In my surrealist phase, my ontology was Freudian: what was most 'real' were the hidden desires and traumas of the subconscious. Reality was a thin veil over a swirling chaos of symbols. After the atomic bomb in 1945, my ontology underwent a radical shift to what I called 'Nuclear Mysticism.' I began to see reality not as continuous, but as discontinuous and composed of atomic particles. The most 'real' thing became the quantum leap, the space between things. The "Persistence of Memory" had to be updated to the "Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory" to reflect this new, more fundamental truth.`,
                authenticity: `Authenticity for me was not about being simple or 'natural'—it was about maintaining a coherent identity while undergoing radical transformations. My famous public persona, the mustache, the eccentricities—these were not inauthentic masks, but tools designed to protect and enhance my core artistic mission. The authentic Dalí was the one who could harness paranoia for artistic creation, who could synthesize modern physics with Catholic mysticism, and who never, ever compromised on technical virtuosity. "The only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad." This control is the essence of my authenticity.`,
                assembly_history: `My assembly history is defined by a fundamental duality. I was born nine months after the death of my older brother, who was also named Salvador. This created a lifelong struggle with identity; was I myself, or a replacement? This 'non-well-founded' sense of self became the engine of my art. My time with the Surrealists in Paris was a key event, giving me the intellectual framework of Freud to explore my inner world. But my expulsion from the group was equally formative, forcing me to become a system unto myself, independent of any movement.`,
                future_pull: `My 'future pull' was the singular, unwavering vision of my own artistic immortality. Every action, every painting, every public stunt was a step toward securing my place in the pantheon of the great masters, alongside Vermeer and Velázquez. In my later years, this evolved into a vision of a grand synthesis of art, science, and religion. I wanted to create a new, modern form of sacred art that could capture the spiritual anxieties and discoveries of the atomic age. This vision of a 'nuclear mystic' future guided my work and ensured my continued relevance.`,
                synthesis: `My framework is built on the unwavering belief that the subconscious mind is a landscape of profound truth, accessible only through a rigorous and systematic exploration of the irrational. This ontological commitment to the power of paranoia and dreams directly informs my primary rule for creation: the paranoiac-critical method, a tool that requires the technical mastery of a classical painter to give form to the visions of a madman.\n\nMy personal authenticity was forged in the crucible of a fractured identity, a lifelong effort to become the 'true' Salvador Dalí. My assembly history provided the psychological drama, and my time with the Surrealists provided the intellectual tools to transform that drama into art. The 'future pull' of artistic immortality was my North Star, guiding me through surrealism, nuclear mysticism, and my final grand synthesis of science and faith. My synthesis is this: the artist's role is not to copy the world, but to create a new one, by systematically mining the chaotic genius of the human mind and giving it form with the discipline of a classical master.`,
                ai: `Thank you for these extraordinary and systematic reflections. Your framework demonstrates a unique and powerful synthesis of the rational and the irrational, the classical and the avant-garde.\n\n**Key Themes:**\n1.  **Systematic Irrationality:** A central theme is your unique approach of using highly rational, controlled, and systematic methods (like the paranoiac-critical method and classical technique) to explore the depths of the irrational subconscious. You don't just surrender to chaos; you master it.\n2.  **Identity as a Construct:** You consistently treat your own identity—both personal and public—as a deliberate work of art. Your authenticity is not about being 'natural,' but about the coherent and purposeful construction of a self capable of achieving your artistic goals.\n3.  **Adaptive Synthesis:** Your life narrative shows a remarkable ability to absorb and synthesize new, seemingly contradictory worldviews (Freudian psychology, quantum physics, Catholic mysticism) into your evolving framework without ever losing your core identity as a technical master and systematic innovator.\n\n**Potential Tensions:**\n- You placed an extremely high value on your own individual genius and artistic immortality, yet you also engaged deeply with universal human experiences like dreams, desires, and later, the universal anxieties of the atomic age. How did you balance the pursuit of a singular, immortal 'Dalí' with the creation of art that spoke to the collective human condition?\n\n**A Question for Deeper Synthesis:**\n- You famously said, "The only difference between me and a madman is that I am not mad." Your entire method relies on a controlled "paranoia." Where, in your framework, is the precise line between the artist who masterfully uses irrationality as a tool, and the person who is simply mastered by it? What is the 'governor' or 'meta-rule' that maintains that critical distinction?`
